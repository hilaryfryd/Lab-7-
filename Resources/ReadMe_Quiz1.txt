Quiz 1

Meeting with Professor Plotka the other week helped me a lot in terms of my vitrual host. I got this page to serve by my virual host more easily than i did lab 3. I attempted to create a local structure in all of the different folders, but ended up embeding it in the file (not sure we were suppoed to do that :).

I had a bit of trouble with my AJAX script. In my lab 4 i had the same issue with ending the statement, but now i know why it was doing that. I still have an error in my AJAX with reading a length of undefined, but I did not have time to fix it in this quiz time. So, my ajax does not really work because of this error. I wish that i had my lab 4 finished and working by the time this quiz took place.
