# Lab-7-

This lab was a little bit harder for me than the past few. Since, my quiz 1 wasn't complete i had to complete that before actually starting the lab. Once i started the lab i was a little bit confused as to how to format the labs and lab discriptions as well as the homework and homework descriptions (i did not add my homework 2 since we all worked on it through github). Once i figured out how to do that, i was able to play around a bit more and have more fun adding in different aspects of bootstrap and jquery.
